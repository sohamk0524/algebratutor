<h1> Unit 3: Exponential Functions</h1>

<p> The next topic we will discuss is exponential functions. As you can tell by the title, exponential functions increase exponentially. An exponential function is made when a value in a data table increases exponentially and not in a constant rate of change. Data tables are used for exponential functions. Here is an example of a data table for an exponential function </p>

<p> As you can see in the image, the exponential function is increasing by a factor of 4. The table doesn't show a constant rate of change. The equation for an exponential function is y=a*b^x</p>

<p> Take note that if b > 1 then the graph will open right and if b < 1 it will open to the left. In the equation, "a" is the y-intercept.</p>
<br>
<p> Here is an example of graph:</p>

<img src="http://www.montereyinstitute.org/courses/DevelopmentalMath/COURSE_TEXT2_RESOURCE/U18_L1_T1_text_final_6_files/image001.png">

<p> In this graph, you can see that the line passes through 1 in the y axis. That means a is 1. If a is one, you don't have to put anything. Also,since the graph is opening to the right, that means b > 1.</p>

<p> To figure out b, you have to take two points on the line and see what is the ratio or factor that the values increase by. In this graph, two points are (1,2) and (2,4).</p>

<p> x values: </p>

<p>1</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>3</p>

<p> &ensp; y values:</p>
<p> &ensp; 2</p>
<p> &ensp; 4</p>
<p> &ensp; 8</p>

<p> As you can see, the x values increase at a constant rate of change, while the y values increase exponentially by a factor of 2.</p>

<p> So, the equation for this graph would be y = 2^x</p>

<p> Here is a graph. The points have already been picked out for you. Write the equation for the graph.</p>
