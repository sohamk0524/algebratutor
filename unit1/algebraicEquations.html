    <h1> Unit 1: Algebraic Equations</h1>
    <br>
    <p> The first topic that you will learn is algebraic equations. In these equations, you are trying to solve for the variable x. A variable is just a letter that is substituted for a number. The variable doesn't have to be x, but it is most commonly used. We will start with simple algebraic equations and then we will move onto multi step equations</p>

    <p> Here is a simple equation:</p>
    <br>
    <p id="unit1-1"> 2x + 10 = 14</p>
<br>
    <p> To solve this equation, the first step would be to subtract 10 from both sides of the equation, so we can isolate the variable with the coeficciant(If it was 2x-10, you would just add ten to both sides). Whatever you do to one side of the equation, must be done to the other side of the equation.</p>
<br>
    <p id="unit1-1"> 2x = 4</p>
<br>
    <p> Now that we have 2x = 4, we need to isolate x. To do this we have to divide the whole equation by 2.
<br>
    <p id="unit1-1"> 2x/2= 4/2</p>
    <p id="unit1-1"> x=2</p>
<br>
    <p> Therefore, the answer to this equation is 2. This is how you do equations. You have to solve for whatever variable is given. We will continue with more advanced forms of equations that involve more steps.</p>

    <p>Here are some practice problems that you can do on a seperate sheet of paper:</p>

    <ol>
    	<li id="unit1-1">5x + 31 = 106</li>
        <br>
        <li id="unit1-1">3x + 6 = 36</li>
        <br>
        <li id="unit1-1">10x - 4 = 96</li>
        <br>
        <li id="unit1-1">4x - 7 = 21</li>
        <br>
        <li id="unit1-1">x + 4 = 22</li>
    </ol>

        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Here are the answers:</p>
  <div class="answers">
    <ol>
    	<li id="unit1-1-answers">x = 15</li>
        <br>
        <li id="unit1-1-answers">x = 10</li>
        <br>
        <li id="unit1-1-answers">x = 10</li>
        <br>
        <li id="unit1-1-answers">x = 7</li>
        <br>
        <li id="unit1-1-answers">x = 18</li>
    </ol>
  </div>
    <br>
    <br>

    <h2> Multi Step Equations</h2>

    <p> The next part of this unit that you will learn is multi step equations. Multi step equations are just like normal equations, but they have multiple steps. For example,
    4(x-5)+3x = 4+3x is a multi step equations because it includes order of operations</p>

    <p> To solve this equation, we have to break it up into parts. The first step would be to simplify all the parenthesis.</p>
<br>
    <p id="unit1-1"> 4x-20+3x = 4+3x</p>
<br>
    <p> Then we combine like terms.</p>
<br>
    <p id="unit1-1"> 7x-20 = 4+3x</p>
<br>
    <p> Then we would do what we normally would in a equation.</p>
<br>
    <p id="unit1-1">4x=16</p>
<br>
    <p> The final step would be to divide by 4.</p>
<br>
    <p id="unit1-1"> x=4 </p>
<br>
    <p> The solution to the equation is x=4. You can plug 4 back into the equation to make sure you got the answer right.</p>
