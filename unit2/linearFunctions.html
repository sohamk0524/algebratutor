<h1> Unit 2: Linear Functions</h1>

<p> The next lesson we are teaching linear functions. A linear function can be written in many different forms. One of the most common ways is slope-intercept form. This form gives you the slope and the y-intercept. It is is:  y=mx+b where m = the slope and b = the y-intercept.</p>

<p> ex:</p>

 	<p id="unit1-1"> y= 3x-2</p>

<p> In this case, the slope is 3, and the y-intercept is (0,-2).</p>

<p> This would be the graph for y=3x-2</p>

 <p> Some questions will tell you to find the slope of the graph. To find the slope of a linear graph. Take the rise and divide it by the run. For example, find the slope of this line:</p>

    <p> To find the slope of this line, you have to find two points the line crosses. In this image, one point is (5,100). Another is (10,200). To find the slope you would have subtract both the y values and both the x values and divide them.</p>

     <p> Basically,  200-100/10-5.</p>

    <p> So, the slope of this line is 20. So the equation of the line is y = 20x.</p>
