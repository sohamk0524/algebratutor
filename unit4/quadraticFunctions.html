<h1> Unit 4: Quadratic Functions</h1>

<p> Quadratic Functions are functions that result in a parabola shape(U shape) There are many formulas for quadratic functions. We are going to talk about a form known as standard form. Before we get into formula, we will first teach the basic parts of a parabola. The main parts of a parabola are the vertex, and the axis of symmetry. The vertex is either the highest or lowest point of the parabola.</p>

<p>Standard form is y= ax^2+bx+c.</p>

<p> To graph the quadratic in this form, we must first find the axis of symmetry. To do this, we have to do -b/2a. Once we have the axis of symmetry, we can input that in the original equation to find the vertex. Plot the vertex once you find it. After, you can find two x values adjacent to the axis of symmetry to the right and left and then draw your U shaped line.</p>

<p> Here is an example:</p>

<p>Graph the equation f(x) = x^2 + 4x + 8. -4/2 = -2</p>
<p> -2^2+4(-2)+8 = 4. Vertex is (-2,4). Two other points are (-3,5) and (-1,5)</p>
<p> This is what the graph would look like</p>

<p> Graph this equation. y=x^2+2x-3.



<p> Here is the answer:</p>
